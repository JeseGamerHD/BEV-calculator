# BEV-calculator
Range anti-anxiety project: Calculator for battery electric vehicle related issues.

The purpose of this calculator is to teach and visualize how different variables impact the range and charging times of battery electric vehicles (BEV). That includes information about how different charging speeds compare to each other in charging time, comparison of their costs, and the required charging for a desired distance or until the battery is full. The calculator also shows the needed energy for the total charge.


# UI for desktop and mobile
The calculator's user interface is made of two main parts: inputs and results that are shown side by side. By changing the numbers in input fields, the result side changes and shows the new values in real time. The calculator has different tooltips for certain parts that explain the shown results or what the input field means. By clicking "Add comparison", it's possible to add a new charger that can be compared to the first one. When the button is clicked, result side shows the new charger and adds comparison bars for both of them that visualize the difference between them in different categories. The website also has localizations for Finnish and English which can be switched during use at any time. 

In mobile view the layout changes so that the result part sticks to the top of mobile view and input fields use the space below it. The results are also divided into three different screens that can be navigated by swiping it. Otherwise, everything works the same way.
